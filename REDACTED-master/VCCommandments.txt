This file contains the rules and protocols for use of the GBS Version Control Software.
Please read through the entire list before using Source Tree and pushing to the team's GitHub.

#There is never a commit too small#
For the sake of not wasting any time of GBS employees, it is better to be overly particular in regards to the size of your committs. 
Therefore, break up your stagings into small units of work. 10 small committs are better than 1 overall commit.

#Committs must be detailed#
Anytime you create a commit, you must write in a detailed description of what actions were taken and goals achieved during this commit.
This description should be understandable by any observer so as to avoid any unnecessary conflicts.

#Never be afraid to ask#
If, at any point, you are unsure of yourself with version control, please reach out to Brett or CJ for guidance on usage.

#Make sure to use updated copies#
Be sure to always pull from the repo when you begin working on a project.
This way, you are always working from the most recent state and are avoiding any unnecessary conflicts in the software.
