# Portfolio
A conglomeration of code and files that I've completed over time to demonstrate knowledge of OOP.

# Disclaimer
As most of my time spent coding is working with a small "start-up" that my friend and I created a few years ago, I desire greatly to keep the content of our work as private as possible. As such, we use NDA's to cover any breach of information. Therefore, any demonstration of my work from GBS will be redacted of any content reference. As such, this repository and some of its code may look strange upon first glance.
